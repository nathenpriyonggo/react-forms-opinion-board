# Opinion Sharing App with Voting System

A React app that allows users to share their opinions, vote on other opinions, and view opinions shared by others. The app includes functionality for submitting new opinions, upvoting or downvoting opinions, and displaying the current state of opinions, including votes. It integrates a backend API using Express to store and manage opinions, while React is used for handling the frontend logic, including form validation, state management, and displaying dynamic content.
This project demonstrates the use of custom hooks, context, and asynchronous actions to manage form submissions, handle user interactions, and perform optimistic updates for the votes.
